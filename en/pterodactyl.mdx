On this page you will find the script to fix the problem of missing connectivity within Pterodactyl docker containers.

<Warning>
   Before proceeding make sure you have followed the [official Wings installation guide](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html) and turned off all containers (servers) on your Pterodactyl panel
</Warning>

1. If not installed, download cURL on your server

   ```bash
   apt install curl
   ```
2. Run the automated script

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://cdn.scheggia.cloud/ptero-fix.sh | bash
   ```
   
   This script corrects the MTU in the Wings config file (`/etc/pterodactyl/config.yml`) and automatically restarts Docker and Wings services.
3. Start your server and check for proper operation
